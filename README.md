# MoReData SPSS
## What
MoReData SPSS is a Microsoft .NET library to process statistical data files created by [GNU PSPP](https://www.gnu.org/software/pspp/ "PSPP - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation") and other programs.
## Why
The [MoRe data project](http://www.sport.kit.edu/more/index.php "German MoRe data project home page") aims to provide a public research infrastructure for scientific motoric research data.

For this purpose, data exchange needs to be enabled in a variety of formats, including but not limited to files used with GNU PSPP.


For various reasons, not at least limited skills and experience in alternative development environments, Microsoft .NET, Microsoft Visual C#, Visual Studio Community Edition and Microsoft Azure Hosting were chosen for the larger project.

From our point of view, this environment seems to lack freely available support of the GNU PSPP data format and we therefore decided to build it.

Since the GNU PSPP source code and, more important to us, the splendid file format documentation, are released under GNU GPL, this part of the project needs to be and should be prepared as Open Source as well.
# How
While the library's source code will be published to this repository, our project's data for testing cannot, so contributions of test data from public sources is what we would primarily be looking for.
